## Challenge Description
The IDS Capture mobile app is responsible for much of our image capture. An important aspect of a digital twin is to see how it has evolved over time. One way this can be done is with before and after photos. These photos are most impactful when they show the exact same view at different times. To aid our users in capturing the same image at different times, we would like the ability to guide the user in matching the exact position and orientation of a before photo when capturing the after photo.

## Pillar ⇢ Capture

## Target Outcome
React native app prototype showcasing capture of a before and after photo, where the capture of the after photo is guided to match the same position and orientation as the before photo.
